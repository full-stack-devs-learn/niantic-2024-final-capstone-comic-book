# Project Requirements

This is a high level description of your project. You should create detailed requirements and update this document
with those requirements. This will guide your development throughout the remainder of the project.

## Comic Book Collection

This application allows users to manage their comic book collections and arrange trades with other users. 

Users should be able to create new collection, and add comics to each collection. Their collections should be
private by default, but they should be given the option to allow other users to see specific books or entire
collections.

They may be able to share collection with a specific individual or make it publicly visible to any other 
logged in user.

Public API data should be used to enhance the import and display of collection items.

This could be modified to manage a different type of collectible I.e. Pokemon, Sports trading cards, coins.
