# Final Capstone React Web

You will create a React web application to serve as the front end or your final capston project.

Login and registration forms have been provided to you so that you can focus on building the applciation.

Authentication is managed using a Redux store along with local storage so users can stay logged in across browser sessions.

## Services
The `AuthenticationService` is used to connect to the Authentication API endpoint to login and register users.

The `DemoService` is a template to demostrate how to add a bearer token to your API request headers. You will need to follow that pattern for any API requests that require the user to be authenticated (logged in).

Feel free to delete the `DemoService` class once you have created your own services and you no longer need the template.
